Trackman
========

Nightingale / Songbird extension that enables batch editing of song metadata. Especially useful for common patterns seen in tango music.

This track metadata manipulator will do many things which can be very time consuming otherwise.

Many of the things it can do are based on patterns seen in Tango music although they
are also seen in classical music an elsewhere.

Swaping of the album artist and artist, Extracting the Album artist and artist from the artist field and the track name.

Extracting composer or genre from the track name.  Clearing of the artist if it 
is the same as the Album artist.

Plus regular expression options to replace any pattern with anything else in most fields. To clear any field, or insert or append anything to any field.

As well as fixing last name first in artist names.

It is possible to do several operations at one time. just select the tracks, and check the boxes and click 'Update Library'.
